        '0 out of 6  The bad news is you’re not very good at Tobago quizzes. The good news is there’s a very easy way to make sure you ace the next one. Read our inspirational Tobago supplement.',
        '1 out of 6  There’s certainly room for improvement but let’s look on the bright side – you didn’t score 0. You do have much to learn about a seriously impressive island so make sure you read all about it.',
        '2 out of 6  Not bad but not brilliant either. You know a little bit about Tobago but could do with a serious refresher course. It’s probably worth considering jumping on a plane over there immediately.'

Not quite ready for Tobago to be your specialist subject on a television quiz show. You get the idea. We’re impressed, though. If you want to achieve perfection next time, this guide will certainly help.',
        '6 out 6  What can we say? Other than bravo. You are either from Tobago or know the place very well indeed. In which case you’re already fully aware of what an amazing island it is. Still, if you want to start planning your next trip, this guide is well worth a look.'
